Stock Price Prediction Using Stacked LSTM Model
This repository contains my project on stock price prediction using a deep learning approach with a Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The primary goal of this project was to predict the stock prices of a company based on its historical data and to analyze how well the model performs on training and testing datasets.

üìå Overview
Stock price prediction is a challenging problem due to the inherent volatility and non-linear patterns in stock market data. Traditional models like ARIMA or simple machine learning models often fail to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. That's where LSTMs excel, as they are specifically designed to handle such sequential data and can model both short-term and long-term dependencies effectively.

In this project, I used a Stacked LSTM architecture, which involves multiple layers of LSTMs stacked on top of each other, to improve the model's capacity to learn complex patterns from the data.

üõ†Ô∏è Features
Train the Model:

Select the company‚Äôs stock (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL) and specify the time range for training.
Train a Stacked LSTM model on the chosen stock's historical data.
Save the trained model in the format StockSymbolStartDate_EndDate.keras.
Load and Analyze the Model:

Load a pre-trained model and visualize:
Training Loss vs Validation Loss.
Predictions on Training Data vs Test Data.
Predict future stock prices for a user-specified number of days.

üìà Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the deep learning model.
yFinance: To fetch historical stock price data.
Matplotlib: For visualizing predictions and performance metrics.
scikit-learn: For data preprocessing and evaluation metrics.

üîß How to Run the Project
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7 or above
Required libraries: tensorflow, yfinance, scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy
Install all dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Steps to Run
1.Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction

2.Create and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # For macOS/Linux
env\Scripts\activate      # For Windows

üß† Model Architecture
The model consists of:

Three LSTM Layers: Each layer has 50 units. The first two layers return sequences to pass them to the next LSTM layer.
Dense Layer: A single output node that predicts the stock price.
Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Optimizer: Adam optimizer.
üìä Results
Training and Testing Performance:

The model captures the trends in stock prices well on both training and testing datasets.
Metrics like MSE, MAE, and R¬≤ Score are used to evaluate performance.
Future Predictions:

The app allows users to predict stock prices for the next n days and visualize the results.
üåü Future Work
Incorporating Sentiment Analysis: Use financial news or social media data to enhance predictions.
Adding Technical Indicators: Include features like RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands.
Real-Time Predictions: Fetch live stock data and update predictions in real time.
Hybrid Models: Experiment with combining LSTMs and Transformers for improved performance.
